# React Firebase Auth Example

> Demonstrates how to use Firebase for authentication in an SPA-style React
> app.

### Features

- Email-based Sign Up
- Email-based Sign In
- Authenticated User Persistence
- Sign Out

### Try it out

Create a Firebase app at
[firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/), turn on Email-based
authentication, and then copy your authentication config values over to the
`src/firebase/firebase.js` file.

Fire it up with `yarn start`.

Give the authentication a whirl. Can you sign up with a new email and
password? Sign out? Sign in with the account you just created?
